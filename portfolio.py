This successfully mitigated the risk of 30% of the budget being reclaimed. The dynamic chart played a crucial role in financial budget management, enhancing transparency in budget execution. It allowed the management team to monitor and adjust budget allocations in real-time on a weekly basis, ensuring efficient use of funds.\n\n"
