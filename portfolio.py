I have a solid foundation in customer service and data analysis, allowing me to contribute diverse skills to every project. 
I had a meaningful internship at Disney in Orlando and worked as a data analyst in the healthcare industry. 
These experiences helped me develop skills in teamwork, analyzing complex data, and efficiently driving project progress. 
Currently, in my student position at Northeastern University, I am not only improving my programming skills but also leading and developing projects to gain more practical experience.
